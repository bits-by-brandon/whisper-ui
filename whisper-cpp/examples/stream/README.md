# stream

This is a naive example of performing real-time inference on audio from your microphone.
The `stream` tool samples the audio every half a second and runs the transcription continously.
More info is available in [issue #10](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/10).

```java
./stream -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -t 8 --step 500 --length 5000
```

The `stream` tool depends on SDL2 library to capture audio from the microphone. You can build it like this:

```bash
# Install SDL2 on Linux
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

# Install SDL2 on Mac OS
brew install sdl2

make stream
```

## Web version

This tool can also run in the browser: [examples/stream.wasm](/examples/stream.wasm)
